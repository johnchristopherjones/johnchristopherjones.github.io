OS X 10.10 (“Yosemite”) is out! That means [Javascript for Automation] is out!

This is kind of a huge deal, up there with Spotlight and Time Machine. It represents a shifts in Apple's philosophical position about OS X (as opposed to iOS). It also stands to makes my life so much easier.

## OS X is for Makers

The OS that runs on the Mac has been through a name shift in recent years. Up through 10.6 (“Snow Leopard”), the OS was called _Mac OS X_. From 10.7 onwards, its name was changed to _OS X_. Mac OS X was envisioned as a “digital media hub”, embodied early on by the [iMac G4] (sometimes nicknamed “iLamp”). Macs running Mac OS X were angled towards _media consumers_. You'd acquire content from CDs, cameras, DVDs, or the Internet; you'd curate it with your Mac with iTunes, iPhoto, or iDVD; then you'd consume it either on your Mac or on your other devices such as iPods, photo printers, DVD players, CD players. The Mac was the heart everything pulsed through.

Then the Internet grew up, digital distribution took hold, and, thanks in no small part to Apple, hard copies on the input and output side of that workflow started dying off. We no longer buy CDs; the trendsetters no longer buy movies on DVD or BluRay; few people re-burn home movies to DVD.

## Why AppleScript?

## Why Javascript?

I personally consider this one of the biggest deals in any OS X release. Super important. I put it right up there with Spotlight and Time Machine. Huge.

So, what's the big deal? The big deal is that now you can use Javascript for things that, previously, you could only ever use AppleScript for. AppleScript is a dirty little, mostly-unregarded, secret in OS X. If you've heard anything about AppleScript, you've heard that it's a horrible language. And yet, AppleScript is still around.

AppleScript isn't around for the same kind of reasons that Objective-C is still around. Objective-C gets attention. It gets improvements. It gets features. It lets you do new and interesting things every year. For those of us that know what AppleScript lets you do, the horrible empty neglect that AppleScript has received over the years has been painful. And yet, Apple never killed it. They would have faced bloody riots if they killed it. AppleScript is _important_.

AppleScript is so important that Apple really tried to fill the gap, way back in Mac OS X 10.4 (“Tiger”). Apple gave major billing to a new application called [Automator]. Automator provided a GUI for some of what AppleScript does. Unfortunately, Automator was rickety and didn't work all that well in 10.4. It slowly improved over each release, until, by OS X 10.9, it was pretty good. But, it still wasn't even close to what AppleScript did. If Automator had been enough, AppleScript might have died off.

You see, AppleScript lets write scripts that control applications. Virtually every application on OS X provides some level of a scripting interface for AppleScript. Plus, AppleScript lets you script the user interface elements in every application. All the buttons, widgets, textbooks, tabs, text labels, windows… everything. That means you can write a script to click buttons, to resize windows. You can write a script to
