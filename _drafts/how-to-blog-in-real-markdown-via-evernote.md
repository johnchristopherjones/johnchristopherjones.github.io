I finally found a way to read and write Markdown in Evernote. Plus, I found a great blogging platform that builds your posts straight out of Evernote.




For a long time I've been keen to write in simple markup languages that let me concentrate on my writing and not on my fonts and spacing—Markdown, for example. A natural consequence of such systems is that it is always trivial to apply whatever styles you want at any given time, provided you get the semantics right. I love this way of writing. It gets all the nonsense out of content creation and let's you deal with the formatting when it's time to present.




This is a wonderfully simple workflow that lets you work entirely in Sublime Text 3. Byword might also work, but I haven't tried it Evernote publishing features.




To write your notes in Markdown in Sublime and get them into Evernote, you'll need an excellent Sublime package titled simply, “[Evernote](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Evernote).” This plugin lets you create, read, and write Evernote notes in Markdown!




Your Markdown structure is converted to ENML (Evernote's note format; a variant on XHTML 1.1) with its Markdown structure intact. You can later read the note back into Markdown.




I highly recommend setting up the suggested key maps. The plugin doesn't do this by default, which is very polite. They let you use your regular keyboard shortcut to save and provide you with an Evernote command palette.




So, that's reading and writing Markdown to Evernote. What about the blogging part? Ah hah! Postach.io is the ticket. It lets you manage your blog posts entirely from an Evernote notebook. The whole service is pretty slick and getting better. Everything you might want to post goes in a Postach.io notebook and is "draft" by default. To post, you tag your note as "published" and away it goes. You can connect your Twitter account as well and automatically announce a post by tagging a post "share." It's swanky.
